Hello everyone! My name is Kudakwashe Chris Chipangura and I'm based in Chivhu, Zimbabwe. I'm very excited for the opportunity to participate in Outreachy with Wagtail.

As a coding enthusiast, I'm always working on side projects and learning new skills. I have experience with Angular, Django, Flutter and FastAPI. I enjoy building things from scratch and bringing ideas to life through coding.

Contributing to open source is the next step in my journey. The welcoming and collaborative nature of open source communities is what draws me in. I'm eager to learn from experienced developers, improve my skills, and give back by contributing quality code.

Django is particularly my first choice when working on most full-stack web applications or as a backend solution. Wagtail, in particular, excites me because I see huge potential for it to grow. Its intuitive editor and flexibility for building CMS-driven websites is fantastic.

I look forward to connecting with all of you.
