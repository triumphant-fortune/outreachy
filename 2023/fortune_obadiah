Hello, World! I'm Fortune Obadiah, hailing from Delta State, Nigeria, and currently residing in Eket, Akwa Ibom. My journey into the world of tech began just three months ago when I embarked on the exciting path of a "Data Enthusiast," fueled by my deep love for all things data.

Before diving into data science, my tech journey started last year as a digital marketer and content writer. I've been honing my skills at Africinnovate, a fantastic tech hub right here in Akwa Ibom, which has been a tremendous source of support for my burgeoning tech career.

My motivation to contribute to the Outreachy project with Wagtail stems from a heartfelt belief that accessibility on the internet should be an inclusive experience for everyone, including those with disabilities. It's my firm conviction that no one should face unnecessary obstacles when navigating websites and the online world.

This marks my maiden voyage into the world of open source, and I couldn't be more thrilled. Securing an internship with Outreachy would be a dream come true, aligning perfectly with my birthday wishes this year - to give back to the community. üéÇ‚ú®

Outside of my tech pursuits, I have a creative side where I indulge in writing poetry, crafting spoken words, and penning song lyrics. I'm also an avid history buff who relishes diving into documentaries and curling up with a good book üìñüéµ. In my free time, I enjoy reading, singing, and experimenting with new recipes. üç≥üé§

I am enthusiastic and fully prepared to roll up my sleeves and immerse myself in the Outreachy community, ready to work hard and learn from the best. Let's make this journey a memorable one! üöÄüåü

##Tasks

[#Outreachy contributor guide]
üëã This guide is our main resource for contributors interested in working on Wagtail as part of Outreachy internships. Please read through it all, top to bottom.
---
[##Communication channels]
Where possible, we prefer you use Wagtail‚Äôs community channels rather than reaching out to mentors or coordinators directly. We use:

The Wagtail Slack, in particular #outreachy
GitHub Discussions
About Wagtail
We build Wagtail, a popular content management system. It's built on Python, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world.

[##Eligibility criteria]
We use the same eligibility criteria as every other participating organization. In particular,

* Contributors / applicants must have been pre-approved by Outreachy in order to be eligible to take part in the contribution period during our project.
* You can only be accepted as an Outreachy intern once.
* You must not have a full-time job or contracting position during the Outreachy internship.
* University students must have 42 consecutive days free from school and exams during the internship period.

[##Contributor expectations]
We expect participants to go through a set of initial tasks as they start to get involved with Wagtail‚Äôs community, ahead of their application. This is for you to get to know Wagtail as a project and community, and get a sense of how we can work together. It also helps mentors assess the skills of candidates, so we can decide which projects we can take on with you.

No matter which specific project idea you‚Äôre interested in, we expect all participants to demonstrate:

* A good understanding of Outreachy.
* Awareness of how open source contributors collaborate: clear and effective communication, use of english, online etiquette, code of conduct.
* An interest in learning and collaboration: improving in response to feedback, asking questions when appropriate, and helping other contributors.
* Awareness of how the Wagtail project works: communication channels, contribution guidelines.
* Knowledge of git and GitHub: coders or not, those are fundamental tools for how we work as a community.

 [##Improve your chances of being accepted]
The best thing you can do to improve your chances of being accepted as an Outreachy intern with Wagtail is to start being involved now. Make yourself known to the community. Go through our recommended tasks below, recommended learning resources, and help fellow contributors who are going through the same process. Try to contribute to an area related to the project you will be applying for. When the time comes to evaluate applications, you will be a known individual.

We're here to help, but we can't watch you every step of the way. We need to see motivation from you. Your activities before the application process are the best way to demonstrate this. Any application submitted late, from people we haven‚Äôt heard from before, will still be considered but might be met with skepticism.

[##Contributor tasks]
We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure you‚Äôre on the right track.

[###Checklist: Getting started with Outreachy]

[###Checklist: open source contributions]
For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to go through all the suggested tasks in a single pull request.

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

[] Make your first pull request with us! Add your name to the list of participants in 2023/README.md.

[##Checklist: your contribution period with Wagtail]
And now, we will want you to start using GitHub so we can review your progress over time, your research ahead of the application, and provide feedback.

[] Read through GitHub‚Äôs Markdown formatting documentation
[] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
