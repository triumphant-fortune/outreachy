Hello Everyone,
I am Nouman Wali. I have been connected with the software industry for the last 5 years. The key skills are HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, UI Testing, and content writing. I have experience in handling web and mobile-based application projects as a project manager in a small software house. While working in the software industry, I realized that writing documentation and interactive content is something that I want to pursue in my life.

I decided to dig more into technical writing. I have been contributing to open-source projects for the last 6 to 7 months. The open-source contribution is really fun and provides professional and interpersonal skills.

This is my first time participating in the Outreachy contribution program. The reason for joining the program is to learn new technologies, collaborate with new people, and get an understanding of the professional environment.

I love to go hiking in the beautiful mountains of Islamabad, Pakistan. The daily jogging and gym workout is one of the important tasks that I do. On weekends, I love to spend some time with my family for outdoor activities.
Thank you
